# COLOR-DETECTION-USING-NEURAL-NETWORK
This project is based on a simple idea of diffused reflection. Using this concept RGB values of the color that has to be detected is calculated and using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP algorithm) and back propagation algorithm the color is detected using the RGB values that was calculated.
